## Introduction
Predicting housing prices is crucial for real estate stakeholders. This project utilizes linear regression to build a predictive model, providing insights into the factors influencing housing prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Price**: Target variable representing the house price.
- **Area**: Area of the house in square feet.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.
- **Stories**: Number of stories.
- **Mainroad**: Whether the house is located on the main road (Yes/No).
- **Guestroom**: Availability of a guestroom (Yes/No).
- **Basement**: Whether the house has a basement (Yes/No).
- **Hotwaterheating**: Availability of hot water heating (Yes/No).
- **Airconditioning**: Whether the house has air conditioning (Yes/No).
- **Parking**: Number of parking spaces.
- **Prefarea**: Whether the house is in a preferred area (Yes/No).
- **Furnishingstatus**: Furnishing status of the house (Furnished/Semi-Furnished/Unfurnished).

The dataset can be found in the `data` folder.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keasamani/Housing-Prediction-Analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd housing-price-prediction
   ```

### Key findings include:

Location (main road and preferred area), area, and amenities (air conditioning, hot water heating) are significant predictors of housing prices.
Larger houses with more bedrooms and bathrooms tend to have higher prices.
